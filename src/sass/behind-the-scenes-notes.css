/* when we say font-size: 150% it means 150% of the parent's font-size. (which could be the HTML or body)
This also applies to percent width.

em's are different:
- fonts are based on parent's font
- widths are based on the current element's width. 

rem is based on the root font-size. (the html font-size) 

Properties related to text (e.g. font-size, color, font-family) are inherited. */
